I work as a Research Biostatistician in the Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics). I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with a MS in Biotatistics in 2014, where my master's thesis investigated methods of handling missing data in type I diabetes clinical trials.   

I have worked in various therapeutic areas including autoimmune disease, obstetrics and gynecology, orthopedics, and oncology, whre I have applied statistical methods such as age-period-cohort analyses, mediation analyses, and hierarchical models, among others. Currently, I am exploring the methodological challenges and practical considerations of publicly profiling providers of surgical cancer care.  

In my free time, I like to make [flexdashboards](flexdashboard.html) for my Data Science I course.
